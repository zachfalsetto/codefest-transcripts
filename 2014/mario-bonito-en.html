			<h1>Mario Bonito: The Future of the Web Experience Toolkit (CodeFest 2014)</h1>
			<p>My presentation is about the future of WET. CodeFest 2013 was awesome it was great was really really cool to be part of it. And now it's 2014 the next year. So as people know, WET has been evolving over the years And it's probably been one of the most exciting challenging projects I've ever been part of But like everything else, movement forward is even more exciting So before I get into the details a little bit about me I've been contributing to WET for about four years fantastic four years I do a lot of extensive work with open source frameworks My handle is Master Bee You probably see me, if you do a search on Google apparently I'm getting quite, I'm all over the place, in many different open source projects which is kind of an ambition of mine I'm definitely an active member I do a lot of admin work for the jQuery group for also the modernizer group modernizer And other, other well yup nope and other kind of open source projects and definitely have a lot of fun with that learn a lot as well the reason why, more importantly because for me I've always been a true believer that internet is what you give back to it.</p> 
			<p>I mean I started beginning my background is actually economics, ironically enough, and what ended up happening was I got involved in web at a very young age in my career and I actually saw a lot of potential in it and the one thing that I was amazed about with web was that the resources were there to be found and people were willing to help and, since, for me I've kind of continued that.</p> 
			<p>I've followed the open source community. I was always baffled with how much I could, you know, I didn't know much about something and I would ask a question and there'd be 30 people that would answer me and I'd be like wow this is an amazing concept.</p>
			<p>So this is how I've kind of followed that where I make it an honest goodness try to give back as much as I take from the internet.</p>
			<p>So, where's WET today? 3200 commits under the hood. Wow that's a lot of changes. Fifty-plus plugins and features Actually since I've been around for a few years during WET I mean that number always seems to amaze me because I remember back in the day as predecessor to WET when we started with the template I think we started with a total of three. It is quite impressive when you look at fifty-plus plugins today. A strong focus on accessibility and performance This has always been, accessibility I think everybody can agree, has always been paramount to WET.</p>
			<p>But the performance has been a later push over from three to four which has been an amazing amazing kind of challenge I guess from a developer standpoint. Backed by solid UX principles and rigour Love the UX guys. I can't stress enough. I can honestly say I'm a developer. Boy, please don't ask me to do any UX design. So the fact that they've come and joined on board has made this such a unique experience. I'm learning every day, Thank you UX people in the room.</p>
			<p>And a larger community then before I can't, I'm always amazed when me and Paul are up at wee hours of the morning, you know answering questions or doing code commits or code review. Yes you guys probably know that I am up at freakish hours in the morning; I love it that much. I'm always amazed to see how many people and members we have and how many active contributions we actually do have in here. So, it just keeps growing. It's a fantastic fantastic experience.</p>
			<p>So, what have we learned? Web is always evolving I think back to me was probably the first biggest, I guess realization when I started getting onto web. Nothing is ever static. The first day you solve a problem you think, oh this is it, I got it, the ultimate solution. Tomorrow someone writes it better. It's an amazing environment to be in because, actually, it does have this kind of progressive feel where you're always constantly learning. But at the same time it does pose challenges for a lot of enterprises and stuff because you can imagine, change is great. Recoding and rebuilding and adapting all the time can be a very costly experience. Never just one thing, never just one way of doing things on the web. That actually is a motto for Pearl programmers, which was one of my core competencies and the web really speaks to that. Nowadays we're getting more and more solutions, more and more frameworks, more and more ways to do the same thing. Which one, it becomes more of a race to find out which is a better fit and which is the smartest choice.</p> 
			<p>Accesibility is both a challenge and reward I was waiting for the "Hummm" in the crowd. Really? Reward? I definitely know back in the YK1 days, in the earlier days, accessibility was always kinda one of those things like, but I want my website to look so cool. I want this running man to swoosh across it. What? What do you mean we can't do this? Accessibility historically has come across as one of those things that have been like, oh we can't make things pretty, we can't make things fun, we've got to turn around and actually make it kinda static and monotone. This is what WET has actually shown me over the past year. That's not true. This is the reward. I actually found it really interesting and learning in my career that accessibility now actually, yes it's there; there are some parts you can't get into and some cool new features, but it actually shows you a different way people manage that information. It actually shows you a different way to view it. We we have a tendency as developers to actually be very focused on, oh here's what the page looks like. And designers have a tendency to say, I want this to look just like this. It's that other side; the people that don't see it that way. Interesting enough. Mobile devices. Things like this. So accessibility actually can be a reward. And this is what WET is really, or at least I am trying to produce and I know the WET community has been really working with that. Hence WET 4 and all its great goodness.</p>
			<p>User-centric design is not just about looking good. I learned that. "Laughter" That was new for me. I really didn't know that. Once again, I kinda put them on the spot and I really do speak a lot about the UX people. That is exactly right. It was for me, it was really interesting because user-centered design was a real exciting piece to it that was kinda, they kept showing, yeah that's fine, you can have a widget, you can have all these cool features and yeah we can make it look fancy and snazzy and go swoosh. But believe it or not actually if you actually do it this way or you actually make it in a way that's usable and practical, people will actually interact with it more often. So it was a really user-centered design was a really interesting kind of learning curve for me.</p>
			<p>Crowdsourcing helps to drive innovation Look around, look at this room. This is this is this is innovation in itself. Crowdsourcing has been a fantastic experience. It definitely taught me how to write better. Yeah there's a few people that are gonna laugh, yeah I caught him at midnight, yeah you should see this guy write. So yeah definitely crowdsourcing was really really exciting and it does help drive innovation; simply because in the past four years with WET I can't speak enough to some of the contributions that have actually come in from open source parties from private sector even from within government which is kind of exciting.</p>
			<p>So, WET 4, what does it give us? Mobile first approach Reusable templates and plugins Better performance And some really cool uses of upcoming and emerging technologies I think Corinne spoke to that and you'll probably see that through the breakout sessions. So, looking into the future, so what's ahead? You know Mario, WET 4 is fantastic it does so much already, so what's next? Sorry, I had to plugin Back to the Future, I'm a big Back to the Future buff.</p>
			<p>Anyway web animations open plugin architecture new synchronization layer and streamlining the core So, web animations. Basically what happens in WET right now, as it stands, we we generally are moving away and trying to leverage some newer technologies to actually do animations that swoosh and that fun and that kind of exciting dynamic feel to a page, without relying on some older JavaScript-type technologies which have a harder time for mobile devices. This is, we've already started to explore some of these benefits. You see them in the carousel plugin, you see them even in the web widgets to some degree; we're starting to move into using CSS and other technologies to try to better leverage that. Obviously, everyone can agree, the upside to that is obviously more performance and smoother kind of animations that are running across mobile devices. And one thing that actually is coming out just the kind of work that we're doing, already. It's generally less complex in term of code. Some of the technologies that we are using to drive a lot of these cool animations that are there, the play button, the spinning wheels and all the stuff actually do get very complex. So now that we're actually trying to use CSS and other kinds of technologies that are a lot thinner, we're finding that people are actually jumping on board a little better and actually saying I can really work with this is make sense. Repurpose and reuse.</p>
			<p>Open plugin architecture The one thing that you probably may see the latest example would be in the web feed widget. There's an example there where we're actually bringing in Facebook and Twitter and you know YouTube and we're putting it behind a nice tabbed interface. This is the open plugin architecture that's gonna be the focus for WET moving forward. We're gonna actually try to start really leveraging blending existence components in. The existing components that we have are really kind of already modular per se, but now we're actually starting to drive them and actually show examples, work on with other developers on how to blend those in to actually solve more problems. Obviously this is going to enable developers to be more innovative. Makes it easier for developers to customize and build upon WET. I think that's pretty, I mean it did does become pretty self explanatory in the sense that we can actually bring in different pieces together to solve a problem. And the interesting part is by making a more application friendly method for leveraging WET. One of the common things that we're seeing with applications is that a lot of them like to aggregate certain sources, they like to bring in three four five different pieces or functionality or features. This kind of open plug architecture we're going to be exploring is going to look at that and actually try to leverage it better for applications moving forward.</p>
			<p>My personal favourite. New synchronization layer The addition of an established open source library called backbone So basically we're bringing, one of the things that WET is kind of in a gap that we have, we don't really have, is that talking back to servers and kind of that discussion between applications and actual platforms back and forth. So WET is basically a framework and its own little presentation layer, but that connector that actually connects it much more, I guess, standardized or more efficiently is kind of missing. This is the new synchronization layer. We're going to be working on actually turning around and giving it a full robust synchronization layer, so actual applications, even static web pages, even even different sources, different platforms themselves actually work and start communicating with the presentation layer almost attached.</p>
			<p>Streamlining the core. I don't think I can speak enough for this. We did it for WET 4, WET 3, all these other exercises. The big thing that we want to do is kind of keep looking at ways to condense and compress the actual already existing 80% optimization, which I think is amazing. There's always room for improvement, so we're definitely going to be streamlining the core, we're going to be looking at different approaches on how to rewrite the core moving forward. This will actually allow us to better extend certain functionality. We definitely, by obviously increasing the performance, well by decreasing the download size, and increased performance were going to get that. And we're going to be looking also at different flexibility models. The actual, currently as it stands, WET is very modular, it's very extensible. But there have been comments that have popped up throughout the open source community about different ways of hey wouldn't it be great if I can if I can really just kind of bring in this real cool feature or this really cool functionality piece in an application or website that I'd like to leverage in, without really having to go off and build a whole plugin or a wrapper around it. So this is the point, the streamlining the core we're gonna be looking at all those angle and all those features to make it almost more plug-and-play, allow people to actually just have this presentation layer where they can just connect all their platforms to it and actually have this wonderful little WET experience.</p> 
			<p>So, how to get involved? Step one, we're all here. That's a good start. We're definitely holding codesrints. Some people may know about them, some people not, but they're actually weekly kind of breakout sessions that we have devoted for the day. We have departments and thank you to the departments, DND and others as well, Service Canada and stuff that host them And basically you just bring the laptop and you know we generally offer WIFI and just come on in there and sit with us and kind of work on certain common problems or actually learn a little bit more about WET. GitHub. I think that speaks for itself. WET is based in GitHub, so we definitely need a GitHub account and actually get familiar with GitHub. And CodeFest. Where we are today. The breakout sessions that we do have are going to be really focussed towards the developer, some of them. There are others that are more under more UX and policy and stuff. So I definitely encourage you to get involved and join in some of these. We have some great ones. Off the top of my head, CSS transitions. The one that I'll be looking at which is more evolving WET. We're looking at that open plugin architecture and streamlining the core pieces. And also possibly talking a little bit more about some really cool buzzwords like web components and so forth in the future. So definitely there. Anyway so once again WET has been a fantastic experience. We have an amazing roadmap ahead. It's going to be a lot of work, but still I think that I think that we can actually make this probably, I'm very excited anyway, about the next evolution of WET, more so about the synchronization layers and the compatibilities that we're going to probably see in the upcoming two or three releases. Alright.</p>
