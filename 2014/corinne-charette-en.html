			<h1>Corinne Charette: Enabling the Government of Canada’s User-Centric Web Transformation through Innovation and Collaboration (CodeFest 2014)</h1>
			<p>So, it's really exciting to be here today.</p>
			<p>It’s a huge pleasure. I’m really sorry I couldn’t be here last year. </p>
			<p>Last year I was only here on video, so it was briefer, but the energy in this room is fantastic!</p>
			<p>And by the way, hashtag, it's BOEW.</p>
			<p>It's BOEW</p>
			<p>B O E W</p>
			<p>What is BOEW?</p>
			<p>WET is BOEW.</p>
			<p>It’s the web experience toolkit. </p>
			<p>So, new acronym for us - WET is BOEW.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the organizers for hosting this in such a great facility here at Carleton.</p>
			<p>Every September, I have to tell you, since I only graduated a few years ago; I have trouble because I always want to go back to school.</p>
			<p>It’s hard that in September lots of young folks are going back to school and we’re in the same office routine.</p>
			<p>It is fun. But it would be nice to go back to school from time to time.</p>
			<p>Anyways. It’s fantastic to be here and to launch this year’s CodeFest.</p>
			<p>I have to tell you just from the beginning</p>
			<p>I’m so proud of what the community has accomplished.</p>
			<p>I am so proud of what you’ve done so far.</p>
			<p>But I am convinced that this is just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
			<p>I really do think that we’ve done so far, what you’ve done so far, is just scratching the surface of what this community is capable of.</p>
			<p>And, you know, frankly it gives me a tremendous amount of joy and satisfaction.</p>
			<p>I brag to the Secretary about it.</p>
			<p>I brag to the President of the Treasury Board about it.</p>
			<p>And I’m glad to see that we get bragged about as a community internationally and in the press as well.</p>
			<p>I would like to reiterate that CodeFest is not just for developers. You don't have to know any coding to participate.</p>
			<p>That's a big relief. It’s been a long time since I put my hands on a keyboard to develop code. </p>
			<p>So, I’m sorry to say that I would not be a very good active collaborator. I’m an active supporter of the collaborators.</p>
			<p>But I want to thank everyone for coming out here. Developers, policy folks and supporters alike. And I want to thank you for your innovation and collaboration.</p>
			<p>So innovation and collaboration are two key words, but in thinking of this talk this morning, can you really innovate by yourself? Is there such a thing as innovation by one person?</p>
			<p>Well you can innovate in a small way by yourself.</p>
			<p>But true innovation is really built on successive innovations, achievements hard work, advancement by communities.</p>
			<p>Gutenberg. The printing press. Arguably a key innovation. He built upon a variety of developments before him, including paper, including the development of ink and so forth.</p>
			<p>The steam engine. He built on the wheel. Bla bla bla bla bla.</p>
			<p>The PC. The Apple. The Jobs Wozniak collaboration and that whole community of developers in Silicon Valley and engineers.</p>
			<p>So the key point here is that ideas come out of individual brains.</p>
			<p>Innovation is the result of successful collaboration by a community of folk. And the ability of a number of people, small or large, to get together and successfully integrate their ideas, challenge each other, merge them, knit them together.</p>
			<p>The power of that synergy when it occurs is really extraordinary and that is what this WET community has proven so far and that is what I think we will continue to prove as we go forward together.</p>
			<p>So, I am a real believer in innovation through collaboration. I think that you folks are the pioneers.</p>
			<p>…For the Government of Canada. I think that the ability to work together, to collaborate; that your openness to this way of working is a new way, it's a way that aligns with the Clerk's view in Destination 2020. It's the way that says that no matter which department you're in</p>
			<p>…doesn’t matter what program area or department we’re in or who our Deputy or ADMs are. We recognize engaged, talented people across the government; we share the same goal; together we’re infinitely more powerful than we are individually.</p>
			<p>And if we can take this sprit, this emerging collaboration muscle that this community has developed and export it across the Government of Canada, the sky’s the limit.</p>
			<p>This is the WET five-year anniversary; I didn’t realize we were that old already. Time flies.</p>
			<p>It was originated in 2009.</p>
			<p>The first release was V 2.0, August 9, 2010.</p>
			<p>It was originally named the GC Web Template, the current name WET, or BOEW, was crowd sourced, so that’s also very good.</p>
			<p>And its predecessor was the CLF Template, which was a good piece of work, but a difficult acronym.</p>
			<p>I love the web experience toolkit.</p>
			<p>There have been 38 releases of WET, from V 2 to V 4, and that doesn’t include all the alphas and betas you’ve put out there in between.</p>
			<p>I still remember in 2012 when Pirth came to me, and he said, Corinne, we need to join the movement towards open source. </p>
			<p>And you know we’ve been talking about open source, and of course we’ve been using Apache, we use a number of open source platforms in government.</p>
			<p>And, you know, it really didn’t, I hope Pirth you agree with me, it really wasn’t too hard a sell.</p>
			<p>Frankly, I am not easy to convince on a number of topics, I confess. That’s because the people around me are all a lot more brilliant than me and they have to keep repeating until I get it.</p>
			<p>He came up to me and he made the pitch to put the template and WET onto GitHub and I thought, that’s brilliant.</p>
			<p>And you know we moved forward with it right away. And that’s certainly been the beginning of an even faster acceleration.</p>
			<p>Today we have 116 members on GitHub. </p>
			<p>Over 300 people when including the working groups.</p>
			<p>The repository, the main WET project area, is watched by 128 people, favourited by 549 people and, this is apparently a word in this community, and forked by 335 people.</p>
			<p>I hope I haven’t upset anyone using that term. </p>
			<p>I’m told this is an accepted term.</p>
			<p>And by the way, in early days, we used to joke about GitHub as Giddy up, as in giddy up, we gotta get going and so that’s coming along.</p>
			<p>So, for today we would understand if someone were to tell us that version 4.0, with version 4.0 of WET it takes 80% less time to load and execute than previous versions and the download size is 80% smaller than the previous versions, which is of course important for mobile.</p>
			<p>But, it’s more important than that. What this shows is that this community is not only innovative, but innovative in a practical, cost effective and efficient way.</p>
			<p>You are sensitive to the needs of the users who are not going to want to sit around and wait and wait for the little round circle to keep going.</p>
			<p>You’re sensitive to the consumption, bandwidth and, you know, whatever, CPU and so forth.</p>
			<p>So, I think that that’s very, very impressive.</p>
			<p>There have been 1,661 commits and 357 thousand plus changes spread over 23 people in the last year.</p>
			<p>What a productive community.</p>
			<p>WET is being used on millions of web pages across the Government of Canada, on Canada.ca, which is the latest version.</p>
			<p>It’s also being used on the City of Ottawa website, a11yQC or the Quebec accessibility conference. This is something else that this community has pioneered; I think we’re world leaders in accessibility and the adoption of WCAG 2. Again, thanks to the efforts of this room.</p>
			<p>It’s on OSACan, Open Source Alliance of Canada, OntarioColleges.ca, University of Ottawa, the Nunavut General Monitoring Plan and more.</p>
			<p>It really is extremely impressive when you think and reflect on those statistics and achievements.</p>
			<p>In a report released publicly this year, IBM recommended to the City of Hamilton that the Web Experience Toolkit is the best fit for Hamilton.ca and their report is available online and I certainly encourage everyone to go read it.</p>
			<p>This community has already been recognized, but I do think that that’s just the beginning.</p>
			<p>The project won the Excellence in Public Service Delivery Award at GTEC 2012, the Share and Re-Use and People's Choice awards at the DPI 2011, which is course of the Association of Public Sector Information Professionals.</p>
			<p>And as I mentioned, it’s been featured in the press, Wired, GitHub for Government, Canadian Government Executive, Fast Company, Mashable.</p>
			<p>How many other federal efforts have been featured in Wired magazine? </p>
			<p>Pretty impressive, I tell ya.</p>
			<p>I started reading Wired magazine at the very beginning and it still is quite the authority in innovation.</p>
			<p>So really, really great progress.</p>
			<p>Last year after Ben Balter came to CodeFest and learned about our project, he called WET the most collaborative open source project in Government in the world! And he should know; his role at GitHub is to support governments in these areas.</p>
			<p>So pretty impressive.</p>
			<p>This year something even more incredible happened. By using third party tools like Twitter bootstrap, we have influenced the accessibility of private sector products.</p>
			<p>Hashtag WET.</p>
			<p>Another important element - Yeah you’re gonna - You know this is my son, I have adult sons and they remind me of the importance to speak in the vernacular of today.</p>
			<p>You know. Hashtag. Right.</p>
			<p>By opening our license for commercial re-use, we are enabling innovation to go even faster. Because, of course, open source is great, but sometimes you do need injections of capital to really spread your innovations worldwide and that is done through commercial third parties that can see some revenue generating potential.</p>
			<p>So that has been fantastic. And we are very pleased with that. It’s a great track record.</p>
			<p>So this is a fantastic community. You’ve taken a whole of government approach that I have long been espousing.</p>
			<p>And you’ve also included and integrated the private sector in this approach, which I have also been espousing.</p>
			<p>You are the leadership model for the future.</p>
			<p>This community is the perfect example of Destination 2020 and we are six years ahead of Destination 2020. So in 2020 who knows where we will be, I’m sure further than we could imagine today. </p>
			<p>So this brings me to the Web Renewal Initiative. Web Renewal for the Government of Canada is a big initiative, as you all know.</p>
			<p>Before we started we had over 1500 individual websites. </p>
			<p>Before starting Web Renewal we had you know individually approximately 1500 websites and that's not across every federal government department or agency, it's just on the top 100, if you will, in Schedules 1 and 2. </p>
			<p>We're already making great progress towards this and WET is part of that progress.</p>
			<p>Over the next two years all these departments will start consolidating their content onto the new Canada.ca, it’s already started, but we are accelerating the pace. We have to make big progress in this calendar year. We've done so but we continue to do so.</p>
			<p>And by December 2016 those 1500 URLs will have been retired, the active content migrated to Canada.ca, which by the way is very slick, which loads on mobile platforms in a most elegant way, so we're very pleased about that.</p>
			<p>And we go through it with quarterly releases, but we would not ever have been able to put forward such an ambitious migration plan for Canada.ca with a traditional project approach that would have been based on the classic pyramid hierarchy, you know, one department when project manager, folks at this level, that level, that level.</p>
			<p>I mean that you know obviously hierarchies exist, and they exist for good reason, and they're very useful, but true acceleration can only occur when you get the kind of collaboration across departments that this community demonstrates.</p>
			<p>So this year we want to use CodeFest to really, you know, set the bar for the next stage of acceleration and evolution. For the Web Experience Toolkit and for the application Canada.ca.</p>
			<p>So we have ambitious plans. </p>
			<p>This year's event is exciting. I'm sorry that I can't stick around and participate in all of it, but I will, I know it's being videotaped.</p>
			<p>So I’ll try to see some of the other presentations one night on the weekend. </p>
			<p>I hope it will all be filmed. </p>
			<p>So there are special guests, participant-led interactive sessions, a policy focussed design jam, which is going to be really interesting, and really there's content for everybody.</p>
			<p>There's content geared for both the technical WET hands-on community, as well as for policy analysts in support of that.</p>
			<p>So, certainly one of the main goals of Web Renewal is to make Canada.ca more user-friendly, I E users need to find what they need, quickly easily and they need to find it at once, without having to do repetitive searches and searching and searching and filtering.</p>
			<p>And quality online services, by the way, is a key step in maintaining the trust of Canadians in their government.</p>
			<p>So it's not only about the obligation to post information online to keep Canadians informed. But our ability to do that well, to engage with Canadians, to present content on the platforms they’re using, wherever they are, in the most effective way. Content that reaches them. Content that speaks to them is helping to solidify trust in government. And that's critical.</p>
			<p>We have great country. It’s a wonderful place to live. We have a great government, and, you know, Canada.ca is a vital part of maintaining that.</p>
			<p>So now up you are going to be able to participate in a lot of things over the next two days.</p>
			<p>You're going to hear from Jane Hazel, the DG in charge of the Healthy Canadians website tomorrow.</p>
			<p>I want to, is Jane here? I want to… She’ll be here tomorrow for sure.</p>
			<p>I want to congratulate them on the great work. Health Canada’s done some great work. As well as a number of other departments. The amount of great work done already on the Travel site on, on Healthy Canadians, on Canada.ca, by the department's leading themes and others contributing to them is something else. So we're very pleased.</p>
			<p>And I myself am particularly interested to see the results of the policy jam that will potentially give us some interesting ways to help reduce the web of rules.</p>
			<p>I don't know of any department that isn't extremely anxious to see how we can reduce, optimise, consolidate our policy environment and the rules that maintain it.</p>
			<p>So, there's a lot happening. But, you know, I want you to know that, while there is a lot happening, I am sending out a challenge to this community, today, at the beginning of CodeFest and a challenge that I think will bring out, that I’m sure this community will rise to and that will help us quite a bit over the next year.</p>
			<p>So, as you know we have a lot of websites but not only did we start with 1500 websites, we also have about 1000 little web applications.</p>
			<p>So we call them web applications. These are not authenticated applications, so we're not talking about CRA and where you file your taxes or, you know, your online account at Service Canada or at VAC or anywhere else. Those are what we call authenticated applications.</p>
			<p>We’re really focusing in, for the, in the initial phase of migration of Web Renewal on those 1000 non authenticated applications that exist all over on these individual websites, although we will eventually get to the authenticated applications as well.</p>
			<p>And what we're trying to do is trying to migrate the best of these applications, consolidate streamline, optimize, while we migrate content to Canada.ca.</p>
			<p>So what that means is that means that we will need a centrally managed presentation layer that all these web applications can use. And if we can do that, we can accelerate the publication of more applications on Canada.ca in different themes, in different areas of the site, because we'll have that WET template and those WET tools and components to build from.</p>
			<p>So I think that this community is key to standardizing in this area and to driving us to the next level of productivity in migration with the work that you're going to do over the next two days and over the next two years.</p>
			<p>So how do we get there? </p>
			<p>Well, I've been reminded of John F Kennedy’s speech on getting to the moon. And he said that the future was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them, but was forged by those who moved forward.</p>
			<p>So, that is really what this community does constantly. And you do this and you make your, the result of your hard work available free of charge to everybody on the planet that can harness it productively.</p>
			<p>So, I am quite confident that over the next two days and over the next year that you will continue to mobilize in this regard. And I'm anxious to see at what speed you actually meet this challenge.</p>
			<p>I'm confident that you will rise to the challenge, that you will adapt or develop new WET tools that will allow you to standardise, consolidate the presentation layer of these small Web applications. And that, too, we will be able to share this with the entire planet on GitHub.</p>
			<p>So, for my part, my office will identify yearly goals, so I now have to go back to the office and think of an even better goal for next year. So we'll see you then, at that time.</p>
			<p>But for the moment, this is a pretty good one and I'm sure that you folks will have fun.</p>
			<p>So five years ago when we started, WET was a difficult task.</p>
			<p>At the very beginning, the idea of standardising, of working together beyond departmental silos, that wasn't easy.</p>
			<p>We didn't even have a very extended, if you will, use GCpedia then and it wasn't necessarily easy to collaborate across departments five years ago.</p>
			<p>Today, we have to stop and we have to thank the pioneers who rolled up their sleeves and who really were the geniuses of collaboration, who said, you know we can do a whole lot more together then we can do individually in our mini little teams.</p>
			<p>So, I want to thank those people and before I conclude and I know I've talked to you too long.</p>
			<p>Today I would like to publicly acknowledge one of the early pioneers of the WET movement in the public service, Pirth Singh. Pirth I want you to come join me on stage. </p>
			<p>Applause</p>
			<p>Pirth has been an unwavering supporter for this movement, for WET, for CIOB, for usability. He's been fantastic. We had to let him, you know be promoted. We had to let him get new assignments in government. It wasn’t easy. I’ve been sobbing for months at this prospect. Service Canada is very lucky.</p>
			<p>But folks, you know what, this is what public service is all about. Pirth is a shining example of public service, destination 2020.</p>
			<p>Pirth congratulations.</p>
			<p>Applause. </p>
			<p>Thanks. And have a good CodeFest. Remember, hashtag WET.</p>
