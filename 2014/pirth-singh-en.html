			<h1>Pirth Singh: Enabling Innovation in the Government of Canada (CodeFest 2014)</h1>
			<p>So I've been saying this a lot to a lot of people this week and I am going to say it again to you. It's truly inspiring to see the amazing turnout for CodeFest this year. We had over 500 registrations and we had to close our registration because we went over capacity1 . That is an amazing amazing thing. So, some of the objectives for this year's CodeFest. In fact we have a bunch of objectives, one of which is that we wanted to increase participation, and we definitely did that. The second one was that we wanted to attract developers, designers, communicators. Really, basically, go above and beyond the developer base from which we started. And also we wanted to increase participation from the private sector. So I'm going to ask you a few questions because one of the first things that I'm going to have to do after I go back to work is make a briefing note, develop one, send it upwards.</p>
			<p>So I am just going to ask you to basically raise your hands. So how many people are attending CodeFest the first time? Wow, that is seventy five, eighty percent, so we definitely increased participation. "Applause" So the second one is, we just want to get an idea about the type of people that are coming. So hands up for all the developers in the house. Significant. About half. So how about UX experts and designers? That's good. About twenty percent. Content developers? Yes. So Jane Hazel will be here to talk about content. So, excellent. Policy folks? That's a really new area that we are trying to focus on this year. So, a few individuals. I know Laura's going to be doing a session. Actually, was it yesterday Laura? Or is it today? Laura offscreen: It's both. It's both. Ok. And managers and executives? "Laughter" A few. Yeah, there were more yesterday, I think, but that's good. And so how many are not from the federal government? Okay, so good about 5 percent. Okay, so that's excellent.</p>
			<p>I think this gives us our objective for next year. It's like, you know, get more managers and executives and get more people from the private sector. So we can definitely do that. When I was talking to Corinne, yesterday, she mentioned next year she wants 2500 people to come to CodeFest 2015. "Laughter" So, my talk is about enabling innovation in the Government of Canada and out of all the things I could have talked about I had to talk about this one. And it's required a lot of thinking. And yesterday, when I was watching Lisa Fast's presentation I think she recommended this book saying called "Don't make me think." So I'm not sure I did the right thing. I wasn't thinking at the time and it's a very comprehensive and a very interesting subject to talk about.</p>
			<p>So anyways I'm going to basically talk about what I think are some of the current enablers of innovation the Government of Canada, as well as talk from my experience as to how we enable innovation in the Web Standards Office. So before we start I just wanted to define innovation. I find every time we go and we use these words, sometimes we're not completely clear as to what we're talking about. So innovation is finding a better way of doing something. It's very different from improvement, which is basically doing the same things more efficiently. So, definitely we need both, but the focus of obviously CodeFest this year is innovation. And how are we enabling innovation? We're doing it in many ways. I don't have to tell you this, but CodeFest is an enabler of innovation. The individuals, the leaders among you who are leading the sessions are the enablers of innovation. Yesterday when Corinne came and talked about the success of this community she was basically enabling innovation. And I don't have to tell you about Blueprint 2020, Destination 2020, I mean, that is the goal to have a high-performing workforce. So definitely there's many many enablers of innovation in the Government of Canada.</p>
			<p>So, yesterday, Corinne Charette, CIO of the Government of Canada, spoke quite a bit about innovation and collaboration which are the themes of CodeFest 2014. There are three things that stood out for me in her talk. The first thing that I think is really really a positive thing for this community is that she acknowledged the successes of this community. And that is hugely important because that is how we going to increase participation. This is how we are going to increase contributions from from from not just the people that are here this year but the other two thousand people they we're going to be getting next year as well. The second thing is that she thinks we've done such a great job she gave us a new challenge. And I think you know she was rushing towards the end because I think she felt that she had gone over time, so I'm going to reiterate what her challenge was. She wants this community to develop solutions, now obviously this is sort of worded in a very high level perspective because we don't want to be dictating how these, what the solutions would be, but she wants the community develop solutions that will enable there to be a common presentation layer that the one thousand non-secure public web applications can use. So what does that mean? Some of you may know that we talk about Web Renewal, we walk about 1500 websites But there are also an additional thousand public-facing web applications. And while Web Renewal will address some of these web applications there are many that will not be migrated over to that particular service. So what she's saying is the community needs to focus on the applications front. And in discussions with many people it's amazing how much effort is expended to improve accessibility, usability, official languages, the branding of not just applications that are developed within the government Canada, but the applications that we procure from the outside. So the challenge of making it easier for applications, to modify and change their presentation layer, making it easier than that is a major challenge she has put forward. So I just wanted to reiterate that because I was very excited when she mentioned that. And if you would have seen Mario Bonito's presentation right afterwards, you would've noticed that pretty much every single bullet that he had on his slides was about making it easy for applications. So we had a little bit of an idea that Corinne was going to say that so the work on that front has already started. And the third thing that I think that she mentioned which I found fascinating was the innovation and collaboration and you know it and her question, which is a rhetorical question, was - can we have innovation without collaboration? And her response was that you can innovate in small ways but for an organization to go forward you really need to have collaboration for innovation. So I really felt that those three things, the successes of the community, a new challenge, as well as linking sort of innovation and collaboration together, were very very important pieces that I took away.</p>
			<p>So, Madame Charette also talked about, she talked about innovation and collaboration, she didn't really talk about a high-performing workforce, but really that was implicit in what she was saying. And we all know that the clerk of the Privy Council, in the blueprint 2020 vision really talks about that. I mean how can you have innovation without having a high performing work force? How can you have collaboration without innovation? So these are all linked to each other and it's important that when we talk about innovation or we talk about these things we're talking about the same thing. And they are really three sides of the same coin. It's a special coin, it's got three sides; but it's very very important to recognize that. So we need all of these to move forward and I'm going to bring the next aspect in. Obviously I read the whole Blueprint 2020 report this week so I'm trying to put in all the words. And I have this nice triangle and I said where's this managing complexity and rapid change going to go? Well it's going to go in the centre. You know as Lisa fast mentioned, that's where everybody looks, so I put it right in the middle. "Laughter" So I don't have to convince anybody here that complexity is increasing and it's not going, to you know, become simpler. It's going to get more complex. And I don't have to convince you that change, the rate of change is increasing itself. So, really in an environment where this is happening, you really need to have more innovation, need to have more collaboration and you need to have high performers who are able to take this to the next step. So all these three aspects are linked and the reason we're doing it is because there is no other way. The traditional ways of managing, I think, are not applicable in this new world. So to recap, the clerk of the Privy Council and Madame Charette in her talk, yesterday, is basically saying we need to do more innovation. Specifically asking you to innovate and collaborate so that we can meet evolving needs of society. And putting it another way, you basically have a license from the clerk and the CIO to innovate, collaborate and support a capable and high-performing workforce. And there really is no other choice. So, it's very important that I wanted to make these linkages because I think sometimes when we mention words and we're not completely sometimes getting the new picture. So I talked about the situation today, about how I think there's a lot of enablers and there's a lot of desire by senior management to see innovation and you can see over here with over 500 individuals that there is a lot of desire to contribute.</p>
			<p>But that's not how it was a few years ago. So I want to give you a brief recap of my experience at TBS where I had the good fortune of leading a very high performing team in the Web Standards Office and Web Renewal. And the team is obviously high-performing because it was the force behind the web experience toolkit, the open collaboration on GitHub, the Standard on Web Usability, which is truly crowdsourced, in government, and of course CodeFest. And, you know, underneath these objectives and deliverables there was a lot of other things that had to happen in the background. And I can't go through all of them, but I'll just mention a couple of examples. What I call one of the secret sauces, which is the open source license under which WET is distributed. We don't necessarily talk about that. And we didn't have that in 2008. And one the first things a lot of departments would talk about is how am I supposed to collaborate, not only internally within government but outside of government, when are there some challenges about contributing code back? Or perhaps contractors or consultants or private sector folks want to contribute and they can't do that because there are all kinds of issues. So that particular license was developed at Treasury Board and there's an entire story behind that which I won't get into. But I remember walking outside, and it was Paul Jackson and myself, after we had left the legal, the legal team that had okayed that, and we looked at each other and we're giving each other high-fives on what a great accomplishment that was. The second aspect I think was really senior management, linking senior management with the actual community. And not only linking them but basically informing them of the work of the community, as well as recognizing our leading contributors. I remember Jeff Braybrook, who's here, who used to be my boss in 2009 and we used to go to the CIO Council and basically identify the top contributors and identify the top departments that were contributing the most people. And we'd go to the CIOs and we would thank them for that. That really encouraged this aspect, of you know, we can get our people to work towards common GC-wide challenges So there were many things that had to happen, but these were not there in 2008. So, in 2008, doing innovation, at least in some areas, was a bit analogous to jumping off a cliff. I don't mean to say that innovation wasn't happening, but it often took mavericks and pioneers with personal drive. Those people who went above and beyond to innovate. Things have obviously changed considerably today. I just mentioned the drivers of innovation; but six years ago, innovation was not a default expectation. So I'm going to give a little bit more about the challenges in 2008. When I first started at TBS there were in total of three of us - me and two other individuals - and it was in the Common Look and Feel Office, which was the former name of the Web Standards Office. And I remember sitting with the team, the three of us, and identifying all the things that we had to do and coming up you, know over, a period of time with that identification of the number people that we needed. And that number was 12. So, essentially, for us to do what we needed, we needed to quadruple our resource base. So needless to say we were not going to be able to address the challenges the traditional mechanisms of hiring those resources; we were not going to get the funds. We needed to find a new way of doing things. We needed to find a new way of doing things better. We needed to innovate.</p>
			<p> And there was another interesting thing that the community was not very happy with the Common Look and Feel Standards. And they let us know very frequently. And they would often say that Standards are impeding innovation. If the Standards didn't exist, the Government of Canada web presence would be way beyond what it was at that particular point. And you know as Mario Bonito mentioned in his talk, yesterday, accessibility has often been seen as stopping departments from having cool websites. So we were under-resourced, we had unhappy stakeholders but we had ambitious goals. So how do we get to a better product? And get our community to like us? And do it with 25 percent of the required resources? So, we focussed on collaboration. We really had good people in the team, really recommitted people on the team. We also realized that the web community was very extremely engaged. Perhaps not always in a positive manner, but engaged nonetheless. So we put considerable effort involving the community and aligning it to address GC-wide web challenges. Individuals from across departments started to get, to come together to develop solutions and that was the genesis of this particular community, this particular movement that has gone to more than 500 people that are here today. And there wasn't any, no there wasn't a strategy and we didn't have a document saying this is the strategy so what are we going to do? But there was a mindset that was open to collaboration. We took an iterative approach. Our small successes provided us with opportunities to take on more bolder objectives. Collaboration led to innovation because we brought in new individuals who had new ideas. And we brought in individuals with diverse skillsets and mindsets. Obviously we all know that it is extremely difficult in a complex world to have any one organization to have all the resources that they require; so collaboration, I think, naturally leads to innovation and that goes back again to what Corinne had mentioned in her talk. Specifically the Standard on Web Usability was invented and developed by the community. Laura Wesley who's here started that and it started from some criticism on an external website of the Common Look and Feel Standards. So we just went out and said, why don't you come join us? The ideas behind CodeFest also came from the GC community and from the private sector, as you can see with many individuals from not just government presenting at the session. And our model became and is that we need to do things once GC-wide instead of 100 times by the one hundred departments. And we didn't do this because we were told but because we have no other choice. We simply found a new way of doing things better.</p>
			<p>So I want to briefly turn my attention to managing complexity and by giving a concrete example. So I want you to take a look at the mind map on up on the screen. And you may have noticed that it coincidently looks like Starship Enterprise from Star Trek. That's a good thing because we want to boldly go where no person has gone before. However, if you look closely and you won't probably be able to look closely here, but you can look at the presentation afterwards, you'll find that the small circles represent many parts of the Web Renewal project. So Web Renewal is complex. Not because any one of those areas is complex; it's complex because of the interdependencies. It's complex because it requires a team with a diverse skill set. And it's complex because we're iteratively developing each of these areas. We don't have the complete solution. And finally it's complex because we have one hundred apartments that are involved. So managing complexity and change is difficult.</p>
			<p>How are we doing that? I want to talk a little bit about, you know, it's good to say that we want a high-performing workforce, but how do you get a high-performing workforce? And, you know, after much thought this week, this is the statement that I finally landed on. It was a very difficult statement to land on. It took hours and hours. I feel that creating an environment where people feel empowered and the ability of managers to demonstrate commitment to this end is the key. I know it's a lot of words, but it's a complex idea. It involves a lot of effort on a day-to-day basis.</p>
			<p>So again I just want to bring people back to a definition of empowerment that I found. Empowerment makes people stronger and more confident, is what I found out this week. And a stronger and more confident team will excel in accomplishing their goals and those of the organization. So there is a rationale on why empowerment drives us forward. In practical terms, this means having people lead and develop solutions in areas that interest them. It involves treating them all as leaders and owners. It involves challenging them and creating an environment where they challenge one another. And there's a little note of caution, high performers sometimes can veer off in their own direction so you always have to like always ensure that we are aligning towards organizational objectives. But they should be given the autonomy to develop better ways of accomplishing those organizations objectives. And you know I will repeat it again to say that the idea, you know for example, GitHub, Corinne talked about the whole GithHub aspect.</p>
			<p>And some of you may know that before we were on GitHub, we used to be on this other platform which was called IRCan, which was a Treasury Board Secretariat led initiative which was basically a source code management system. And you know the first time somebody said, "hey we should go on GitHub," you know, there's a fear factor. But that idea was brought up by the team. And through, I would say, a period of weeks and months, we went through a challenge process. We had to build a solid rational case; we had to get the open source license, which actually had been developed a little bit before; but we also had to address the challenges that the CIOs would ask, which is, what about security? What about somebody putting something in this code which would then bring all our 1500 websites down to a stall. So there was a challenge function that was conveyed. So when I talk about allowing people, making people feel empowered, but then challenging them, not just yourself, but in a team, then we can come up with better solutions. And then the other aspect I think is the whole aspect of commitment. I thought that one must demonstrate complete commitment to this end. And you know you need uphold these principles on a day-to-day basis with your team, because people look at what you doing, not necessarily what you're talking about. And so doing it on a day-to-day basis, they see it and then they know that you believe it and then that is that is how we go forward. And just to say that, whether it's a manager or executive, if you're going to say we need to create an environment of challenging each other then you also have to be ready to be challenged. It can't just be a one-way street.</p>
			<p>So I'm going to bring my triangle back. So innovation, collaboration, a capable, high-performing workforce are often one and the same. You can't have one without the other. There's no other choice to doing, to managing the world which is becoming more complex and change is very rapid. That should be of interest to the managers and executives because the traditional ways of managing resources may not work as well.</p>
			<p>And I want to return to my earlier point about how you can be part of this broader movement of innovation that's already happening. Like I said before, there are a lot of activities underway where departments and individuals are being asked to innovate, so it's much easier today. Number one is you can be part of this particular group. As you know the Government of Canada CIO just gave a new challenge about applications. So that is an opportunity. Continue to improve the Web Experience Toolkit in order to make Canada.ca better. But also there's an opportunity to address the whole application space. If you're designer, developer, communicator, contribute any way to this work, whether through working groups or through GitHub. Another approach is, I was just sitting over there yesterday, when Jacques Mailloux, the CIO of Elections Canada, was having a discussion with Corinne and his point was that this particular model could be applied to so many other challenges in the Government of Canada, so many different communities. So the second way that you can be part of this innovation movement is that you can apply this model, apply the collaborative model, to other to aspects within the Government of Canada.</p>
			<p>So in closing, I want to reiterate that the successive this community has received significant attention by senior management in the Government of Canada. The leading contributors in this community are also being recognized. That recognition is going to encourage more participation and should help in attracting talent from inside and outside of government to the efforts of this community, as well as other communities that adopt similar methods And that is 100 percent right.</p>
